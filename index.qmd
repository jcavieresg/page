I am a postdoctoral researcher in the "[Chair of Spatial Data Science and Statistical Learning](https://uni-goettingen.de/en/629104.html)" at Georg-August-Universität Göttingen. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the "[Chair of Geoinformatics-Big Spatial Data](https://www.geoinformatics.uni-bayreuth.de/en/)" at Bayreuth University. My doctoral thesis was supervised by [Javier Contreras Reyes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier-Contreras-Reyes)" and [Michael Karkulik](http://mkarkulik.mat.utfsm.cl/), proposing different computational methods to incorporate a smoothing thin plate spline in spatial models. During my doctoral studies I did two very interesting internships; the first one in the Probabilistic Machine Learning group at Aalto University, under the supervision of [Aki Vehtari](href="https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/). The second one was in the Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering Division at KAUST, under the supervision of [Paula Moraga](https://www.paulamoraga.com/).
I have also worked as Data Scientist in the retail (Cencosud-Scotiabank) and the forest industry (Arauco Celulosa).
Generally I use R, Template Model Builder (TMB) and Stan to develop probabilistic models, but I am also interested in numerical methods (from a  deterministic approach) for spatial models using Rcpp/RcppArmadillo. 

Most of my life was in the beautiful Valparaíso. However (sorry to the this), my favorite place in the world is **Los Vilos**!
